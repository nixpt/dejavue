# Dejavue Roadmap

Shipped vs in-flight vs future. For per-release details see `CHANGELOG.md`.

---

## ✅ Shipped

### v1.0.0 — stable release (2026-05-27)

On-disk format frozen. 20 commands, 62/62 tests.

**New commands:** `version`, `status`, `log` (+ --since/--agent/--type/--oneline),
`blame`, `note`.

**v0.3 wave (capture discipline + map):**
- Ambient agent identity (AGENT_NAME / CLAUDE_CLI / GIT_AUTHOR_NAME / config file)
- `context` staleness warnings + pre-push hook safety net
- `init --ingest`, `init --map`, `ingest --generate-map`
- `fcntl.flock` concurrent safety on FTS rebuild + ingest
- Per-repo `.dejavue/config` defaults file
- `.gitignore` entries installed by `dejavue init`

### v0.1 — first release (2026-05-13, s156)

The zero-ceremony per-repo agent memory layer. 13 commands, FTS5 keyword
recall, git post-commit hook, `merge=union` `.gitattributes`, 33/33 tests.
Single Python file, stdlib only.

### v0.2 — semantic recall (2026-05-13, s160)

`dejavue recall --semantic` with cosine-ranked retrieval against an
OpenAI-compat embeddings endpoint, content-addressed cache, graceful FTS5
fallback. No new runtime deps (`urllib.request`).

### Patch-level fixes (2026-05-15, s167–s168)

- `dejavue handoff --next` is now repeatable (`action="append"`); multiple
  next-steps render as a bullet list. Single-value usage unchanged.
- Post-commit hook now captures **merge + root commits** correctly. The
  old `git show --name-only` silently emitted nothing for merge commits
  (default `--diff-merges=off`), so multi-agent projects were losing ~70%
  of capture (Khukuri case study, 9 of 13 commits missing). Fix:
  `git diff-tree --no-commit-id -r --name-only -m --first-parent --root`
  to handle merges + root commits uniformly.

---

## ✅ v0.3 — capture discipline + codebase map (shipped as v1.0.0)

Phases 1-7 shipped in the v1.0.0 wave. Phase 6 (commit-msg
`Dejavue-Event:` trailer via `git interpret-trailers`) deferred to v1.1 —
the amend-from-hook pattern risks infinite loops and needs a safer design.

Test gate achieved: 62/62 (was ≥50/50 target).

---

## ✅ v1.1.0 — operational + reliability wave (2026-05-28)

25 commands, 71/71 tests.

- `check` — git-fsck health check (JSONL, hooks, .gitattributes, .gitignore, FTS, map.md)
- `archive --before <date>` — timeline compaction (drops old file_changed, preserves decisions)
- `roster` — agent activity summary (first/last seen, session/decision/note counts)
- `config {list,get,set,unset}` — manage .dejavue/config through the CLI
- `install-skill` — auto-install SKILL.md to ~/.claude/skills/ (or --dir)
- `log --reverse` flag; `recall --limit N` flag
- Embedder circuit breaker (3 failures → 5-min cooldown; state in embedder_circuit.json)

## ✅ v1.2.0 — expression + discovery wave (2026-05-28)

31 commands, 88/88 tests.

- `--type` on `decision` (blocker/claim/question/experiment/checkpoint) + on `note`
- `stats` — event statistics with mini bar chart
- `export --format {json,md}` — full memory snapshot export
- `reference {create,list,update,view}` — reference card management via CLI (`--template api/design`)
- `link <sha>` — reverse-lookup dejavue events for a git commit
- `search` — discoverable alias for `recall`
- `context -n N` — control boot-packet event count
- Tiered embedder auto-detect (ollama → OpenAI → FTS5 fallback)
- Model-aware embedding cache (stale vectors from old model ignored)

## ✅ v1.3.0 — depth + git integration wave (2026-05-28)

36 commands, 100/100 tests.

- `diff <from> [<to>]` — compare memory between two refs (dates or commits); unified diff of state.md/decisions.md + event window
- `timeline [--by day/week/month] [--agent]` — ASCII bar chart of activity over time
- `check --fix` — auto-repair: install missing hooks, .gitattributes, .gitignore, rebuild stale FTS
- `tag {list, filter <tag>}` — list unique tags with counts; filter events by tag
- `note-commit <sha>` — write git note linking commit to last dejavue event (`git notes append`)
- `link` now reads git notes written by `note-commit`
- `event_type` field indexed in FTS5 — `recall blocker` finds `--type blocker` events
- `since` now shows a Notes section (notes in time window with tag + sub-type labels)

## 📌 Reconciliation note (s241, 2026-06-05)

Several items previously listed as "v1.4 candidates" **already shipped in
v1.3.0** — this section was drifted. Corrected:

- ✅ `dejavue diff <from> [<to>]` — **shipped v1.3.0**
- ✅ `dejavue timeline` (activity chart) — **shipped v1.3.0**
- ✅ `dejavue check --fix` (auto-repair) — **shipped v1.3.0**
- ✅ `log --type` / FTS5 `event_type` indexing — **shipped v1.3.0**

## ✅ v2.0.0 — DCP (DejaVue Context Protocol) — shipped (2026-06-05, s241)

The maturation step (captain-directed s241) evolves dejavue from *per-repo
agent memory* into **DCP — a portable context interchange standard**: `.dejavue/`
becomes the single source of truth; `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md` /
Copilot rules become **generated, non-destructive adapter targets**. dejavue is
the reference implementation; the protocol has a citable spec (Foundry / OCPL).

Shipped s241 across parallel horses (spec/positioning + code), **119/119 tests**,
zero new deps. Release line **v2.0.0**; format backward-compatible (additive, DCP §7).

**Wave (all shipped):**
- ✅ `docs/dcp-spec.md` — **the DCP/1.0 standard** (three layers, Axiom 0,
  adapter + import contracts, `.dejavue/` layout, conformance).
- ✅ README / STEWARDSHIP repositioned — "portable context + memory + adapter
  bridge"; DCP/1.0 named as the stewarded standard; `foundry.toml` → `dcp:1.0`.
- ✅ `context.md` instruction layer + `init` scaffold + `context` surfaces it.
- ✅ `dejavue import <FILE>` — lossless seed of `context.md` (provenance recorded).
- ✅ `dejavue export --target {claude,codex,gemini,copilot,cursor,all}` —
  non-destructive managed-block adapters (append-and-warn / `--replace`; hash staleness in `check`).
- ✅ `references/glossary.md` glossary reference card.
- ✅ Stdlib v1.4: `promote --to jagent`, `init --wizard`, reference frontmatter, `diff --format patch`.

**Axiom 0 — Zero-ceremony conformance (hard invariant):** a conforming DCP tool
MUST be usable with no configuration and no files beyond what `init` creates.
Every layer above the base memory log (`context.md`, adapters, glossary,
frontmatter) is **optional and additive**; the base five-command loop
(`init → start → decision → state → handoff`) is frozen and unchanged. **No new
runtime dependency may ever be introduced** (this is why the ONNX embedder tier,
below, is dropped — it would break the single-file stdlib contract).

Design + waves: `docs/plans/2026-06-05-dcp-maturation.md`.

## 🔮 Remaining candidates (post-reconciliation)

> DCP wave + the stdlib v1.4 features all shipped in **✅ v2.0.0 — DCP** above.

### Dropped (contract conflict — see Axiom 0)
- ~~**Local ONNX embedder tier**~~ — would require `onnxruntime`, breaking the
  stdlib-only / no-new-deps invariant. Dropped. (Optional out-of-process
  shellout could be revisited, but never as an import.)

### Lower impact
- **`dejavue archive --compress`** — zstd-compress the backup file on archive (stdlib `zlib`/`lzma` only — no zstd dep).

### MCP-only (separate horizon, joker ecosystem)

- MCP tool wrappers around the 13 CLI commands so MCP-native agents can call dejavue via structured tool-use instead of shell. Stays optional — never breaks the zero-ceremony / format-as-contract invariant.

---

## 🛑 Out of scope (won't ship in dejavue itself)

- **`joker-memory` Rust crate consolidation** (audit §860-962) — that's a Squadron-side refactor (unify `agent-mem` / `agent-lib` / `librarian-cli` / `joker-core/embedding` into one trait-backed Rust crate). Dejavue's role there is "thin Python consumer of the same contract." Tracked at the workspace level, not here.
- **Inferno-style 9P/Styx service-tree namespaces, capsule isolation, et al.** — exosphere-side work.
- **Anything that breaks the contract:** new runtime dependencies beyond stdlib, multi-file rewrites of `dejavue.py`, MCP-mandatory operation, mandatory config files.

---

## Source references

- **Audit:** `.squad/teams/engineering/dejavue-assessment.md` (1031 lines; rounds 1-3: arniko-core greenfield + Khukuri stress test + Squadron/joker-core pattern portability + consolidation map). Author: opencode (engineering loan). Foreman correction note at lines 189-209 (the audit's drop-in hook-fix recommendation was empirically broken; real fix uses `-m --first-parent --root`).
- **Map spec:** `projects/incubator/dejavue-map-spec.md` (463 lines). 6-phase adoption strategy for `.dejavue/references/map.md` + sibling reference docs.

Both source docs live in foreman's workspace, not this repo. The above
summary is what's load-bearing for dejavue itself; the source docs cover
more (workspace-level consolidation, etc.) that doesn't fit here.

---

## How this roadmap is maintained

- Versions move from 🚧 → ✅ on tag.
- v0.4 candidates re-prioritize when captain picks the next wave.
- Out-of-scope items stay listed so the next reader doesn't re-propose them.
- The map spec + audit are the canonical sources for v0.3 design questions.
  If something contradicts them, fix this file or one of those — don't let
  the inconsistency rot.
